    "paragraph": "Started off in the year 2020 with a motive of spreading the knowledge that we gained through various guru's. In all the chaos of our daily routine, little bit of fun and dance in the weekend is the only thing that charges us up for a fresh week. The best way of learning dance is thought in the organisation. With your help we will reach greater heights!.",
